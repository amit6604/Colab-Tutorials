In our case, the target will be the digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the observations are the intensity and relative position of the pixels. After some training, it is possible to generate a \"function\" that map inputs (digit image) to desired outputs(type of digit). The only problem is how well this map operation occurs. While trying to generate this \"function\", the training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data."
